# Google Classroom RubricMaker

## Rationale
I created this to make it easier to generate rubrics in the proper format to be imported into Google Classroom. When editing an assignment, you can create a rubric but you can also import from Sheets. My script generates a Google Sheet that allows you to select certain learning targets and allow them to be imported correctly into Classroom.

## Usage
Copy the Google Sheet available here: [Google Classroom RubricMaker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMugQFmxFl5JWtNfcGzrE1Z0E_VqRskVYaMTInfQm4A/copy)
