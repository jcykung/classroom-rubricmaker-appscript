# Google Classroom RubricMaker

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/E1E41BI6JX)

## Rationale
I kept having to retype or copy and paste rubrics when creating new Google Classroom Assignments and wanted an easy way to generate a rubric on a Google Sheet which I could then import into Classroom (Google Classroom allows you to import rubrics from Google Sheets as long as it's in the proper format). So, I created this script that allows you to paste in a master rubric with all your learning targets and convert it into a format that Google Classroom will accept. Not only that, but you can reuse this Google Sheet and select learning targets specific to an Assignment and easily import that ready-made rubric into Classroom whenever you create a new Assignment. For my own use, I have duplicated the "Google Classroom RubricMaker" sheet and have a copy for each course I teach with a master rubric imported for each course, ready to go.


## Usage
Copy the Google Sheet available here: [Google Classroom RubricMaker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sMugQFmxFl5JWtNfcGzrE1Z0E_VqRskVYaMTInfQm4A/copy)

![How to use it animated gif](rubricmaker.gif)

1. Paste your rubric in the format given on the "Paste Rubric" sheet.
2. Rubric Tools > Extract Learning Targets to convert your rubric and add it to the "Select Learning Targets" sheet.
3. Add in short descriptions (short descriptions allow students to see 1 or 2 word summaries of the learning target).
4. Select the learning targets you want to include for your Google Classroom Assignment by checking the checkboxes.
5. Rubric Tools > Create Rubric.
6. In Google Classroom, go to your Assignment. After entering the details of the assignment, add a rubric and select "Import from Sheets". Select the sheet you just made.

\* You can change the headings to something other than "Beginning", "Developing", "Competent", and "Mastery" and the new headings will be transferred to the "Select Learning Targets" sheet.

\* You can duplicate this sheet for different courses and generate rubrics for each course as you like.
